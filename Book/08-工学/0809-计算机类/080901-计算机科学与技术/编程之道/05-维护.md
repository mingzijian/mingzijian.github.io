> Thus spake the Master Programmer:

编程大师曰：

> "Though a program be but three lines long, someday it will have to be maintained."

虽三行之程序，必有需人维护之日。

> A well-used door needs no oil on its hinges.A swift-flowing stream does not grow stagnant.

户枢不蠹。流水不腐。

> A deer blends perfectly into the forest colors.

小鹿共森林一色。

> Software rots if not used.

若无人使，程序必死。

> These are great mysteries.

此谓大玄。



> A manager asked a programmer how long it would take him to finish the program on which he was working. "I will be finished tomorrow," the programmer promptly replied.

主管问猿，程序何时写毕。“明日毕，”猿断然曰。

> "I think you are being unrealistic," said the manager, "Truthfully, how long will it take?"

主管曰，“不切实际，实言之，到底要多久？”

> The programmer thought for a moment. "I have some features that I wish to add. This will take at least two weeks," he finally said.

猿浅思片刻曰。“吾欲补数功能，此至少需两周，”

> "Even that is too much to expect," insisted the manager, "I will be satisfied if you simply tell me when the program is complete."

主管曰：“两周亦期望过高也汝告之我于将毕，吾知足矣。”

> The programmer agreed to this.

猿同意之。

> Several years later, the manager retired. On the way to his retirement luncheon, he discovered the programmer asleep at his terminal. He had been programming all night.

数年后，主管退休矣。赴会退休午宴之途，见猿睡于电脑前。概其彻夜写代码矣。

> A novice programmer was once assigned to code a simple financial package.

昔有大师，令其弟子编一简易财务系统。

> The novice worked furiously for many days, but when his Master reviewed his program, he discovered it contained a screen editor, a set of generalized graphics routines, and an artificial intelligence interface, but not the slightest hint of anything financial.

弟子疯狂写代码数日。大师查其进度，其视程序中多一屏幕编辑器、一通用之图形程序和一人工智能之界面，却未见任何与财务相关之物。

> When the Master asked about this, the novice became indignant. "Don't be so impatient," he said, "I'll put in the financial stuff eventually."

当大师提及此处，弟子气曰。“请耐心待之，吾将写财务部分于后。”

 



> Does a good farmer neglect a crop he has planted?

为农善者会随意待己种之庄稼乎？

> Does a good teacher overlook even the most humble student?

为师善者会忽视其至谦之学生乎？

> Does a good father allow a single child to starve?

为父善者舍令其子挨饿乎？

> Does a good programmer refuse to maintain his code?

为猿善者会拒绝维护己之代码乎？
