> Thus spake the Master Programmer:

编程大师曰：

> "A well-written program is its own Heaven; a poorly-written program is its own Hell."

“程序优者似置身天堂，程序拙者如身赴地狱。”

> A program should be light and agile, its subroutines connected like a string of pearls. The spirit and intent of the program should be retained throughout. There should be neither too little nor too much. Neither needless loops nor useless variables; neither lack of structure nor overwhelming rigidity.

程序应当轻巧灵活，内部子过程彼此连接，串若珍珠。程序之精神和目的，当一以贯之。代码量须恰好，减之则少，增之则多。无循环或变量之赘。既不失整体结构，亦不至僵化死板。

> A program should follow the "Law of Least Astonishment". What is this law? It is simply that the program should always respond to the users in the way that least astonishes them.

程序当循“最少惊惑原则”。此原则甚易：程序返回之结果永符用户之预期。

> A program, no matter how complex, should act as a single unit. The program should be directed by the logic within rather than by outward appearances.

无论程序之何繁，皆可作一独立单元运行之。程序应为内在之逻辑指导，而不为前端之形式左右。

> If the program fails in these requirements, it will be in a state of disorder and confusion. The only way to correct this is to rewrite the program.

不符上述要求之程序将陷于无序与混乱。唯重写以修之。



> A novice asked the Master: "I have a program that sometimes runs and sometimes aborts. I have followed the rules of programming, yet I am totally baffled. What is the reason for this?"

弟子问之于大师曰：“吾之程序，时通而时不通。编程法则吾亦遵之，实惑无策。何故？”

> The Master replied: "You are confused because you do not understand Tao. Only a fool expects rational behavior from his fellow humans. Why do you expect it from a machine that humans have constructed? Computers simulate determinism; only Tao is perfect.

大师答：“心存疑惑，因尔尚未悟道。唯有傻子才会期望世人举止理性。你又如何期望世人建造的机器能有理性的行为呢？计算机只能模拟决定论；唯道完美。

> The rules of programming are transitory; only Tao is eternal. Therefore, you must contemplate Tao before you receive Enlightenment."

编程无常法，唯道恒久远。欲获启示，必先悟道。”

> "But how will I know when I have received Enlightenment?" asked the novice.

“然何以知之吾已获启示？”弟子问。

> "Your program will run correctly," replied the Master.

“尔之程序运行无误”大师答。



> The Master was explaining the nature of Tao to one of his novices.

大师正释道之本于其弟子。

> "The Tao is embodied in all software -- regardless of how insignificant," said the Master.

“凡软件者，皆有道存，不以其微而不存。”大师曰。

> "Is the Tao in a hand-held calculator?" asked the novice.

“道存之于手持计算器耶？”弟子问。

> "It is," came the reply.

“存”大师答。

> "Is the Tao in a video game?" asked the novice.

“道存之于电子游戏？”

> "It is even in a video game," said the Master.

“亦存。”

> "Is the Tao in the DOS for a personal computer?" asked the novice.

“ DOS 亦有道乎？”

> The Master coughed and shifted his position slightly. "The lesson is over for today," he said.

大师轻咳一声，微微一动。“今日之课止至于此。”



> Prince Wang's programmer was coding software. His fingers danced upon the keyboard. The program compiled without and error message, and the program ran like a gentle wind.

王氏企业内，一猿正编写软件。其指尖飞舞于键盘之上。程序编译时无任何错误，运行时亦如清风拂过，丝滑顺畅。

> "Excellent!" the Prince exclaimed. "Your technique is faultless!"

“壮哉！”王总惊呼道，“汝之技甚佳！”

> "Technique?" said the programmer, turning from his terminal, "What I follow is Tao -- beyond all techniques! When I first began to program, I would see before me the whole problem in one mass. After three years, I no longer saw this mass. Instead, I used subroutines. But now I see nothing. My whole being exists in a formless void. My senses are idle. My spirit, free to work without a plan, follows its own instinct. In short, my program writes itself. True, sometimes there are difficult problems. I see them coming, I slow down, I watch silently. Then I change a single line of code and the difficulties vanish like puffs of idle smoke. I then compile the program. I sit still and let the joy of the work fill my being. I close my eyes for a moment and then log off."

猿转身曰：“技？吾所求为道也——越技之道！吾编程之初，问题堆积成团、杂乱如麻。三年后，再未见此等问题，概因 子程序。如今，吾目不见万物矣。吾之存在若虚若无，不感万物。吾之精神不受约束，全凭本能自由工作。换言之，吾写程序时，代码乃自显之也。然，亦时遇棘手之问题。吾慢而静观之，后吾改动一行代码，问题灭如轻烟。吾始编译程序。静坐，感乐盈满身心。吾闭目冥想片刻，后退出系统。”

> Prince Wang said, "Would that all of my programmers were as wise!"

王总曰：“愿吾司所有的猿都这样聪明！”
