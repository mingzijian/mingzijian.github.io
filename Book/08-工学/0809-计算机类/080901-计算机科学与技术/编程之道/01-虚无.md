## The Silent Void 虚无

> Thus spake the Master Programmer:

编程大师曰：

> "When you have learned to snatch the error code from the trap frame, it will be time for you to leave."

“慧眼识错日，学成离开时。”

> Something mysterious is formed, born in the silent void. Waiting alone and unmoving, it is at once still and yet in constant motion. It is the source of all programs. I do not know its name, so I will call it the Tao of Programming.

有物混成，生与虚无。寂兮寥兮，独立而不改，周行而不殆，可以为程序源。吾不知其名，强字之曰“编程之道”。

> If the Tao is great, then the operating system is great.
> If the operating system is great, then the compiler is great.
> If the compiler is great, then the application is great.

故道大，操作系统大，编译器大，程序亦大。

> The user is pleased, and there is harmony in the world.

用者乐则天下和。道法自然。

> The Tao of Programming flows far away and returns on the wind of morning.

编程之道随流水以远，又乘晨风而归。

强为之名曰：大。大曰逝，逝曰远，远曰反。

> The Tao gave birth to machine language. Machine language gave birth to the assembler.
> The assembler gave birth to the compiler. Now there are ten thousand languages.

编程之道生机器语言，机器语言生汇编器。汇编器生编译器。今万千语言生。

> Each language has its purpose, however humble. Each language expresses the Yin and Yang of software. Each language has its place within the Tao.

凡言自有其义，不以微失。凡言皆表阴阳，皆存与道。万物负阴而抱阳，冲气以为和。

> But do not program in COBOL if you can avoid it.

如非必要，不用商言（Common Business-Oriented Language） 。

> In the beginning was the Tao. The Tao gave birth to Space and Time.
> Therefore Space and Time are the Yin and Yang of programming.

初为道。道生时空。
时空者，编程之阴阳。

> Programmers that do not comprehend the Tao are always running out of time and space for their programs. Programmers that comprehend the Tao always have enough time and space to accomplish their goals.
> How could it be otherwise?

悟道前，猿每尽耗程序之时空。悟道后，猿达程序之的而时空有余。
何能逆之？

> The wise programmer is told about Tao and follows it. The average programmer is told about Tao and searches for it. The foolish programmer is told about Tao and laughs at it.
> If it were not for laughter, there would be no Tao.

上猿闻道，勤而行之； 中猿闻道，若存若亡；下猿闻道，大笑之。 
不笑不足以为道。

> The highest sounds are hardest to hear. Going forward is a way to retreat. Great talent shows itself late in life. Even a perfect program still has bugs.

大音希声。进道若退。大器晚成。大成若缺。
