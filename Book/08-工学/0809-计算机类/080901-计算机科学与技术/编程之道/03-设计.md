> Thus spake the Master Programmer:

编程大师曰：

> "When a program is being tested, it is too late to make design changes."

“待程序入测阶，凡设计之修改皆晚矣。”

> There once was a man who went to a computer trade show. Each day as he entered, the man told the guard at the door:

昔有一人，往参计算机之商展。每日入门，必问于守卫：

> "I am a great thief, renowned for my feats of shoplifting. Be forewarned, for this trade show shall not escape unplundered."

“吾乃窃贼中佼佼者，最擅顺手牵羊，颇负盛名。特告与尔，此展会吾亦盗之。”

> This speech disturbed the guard greatly, because there were millions of dollars of computer equipment inside, so he watched the man carefully. But the man merely wandered from booth to booth, humming quietly to himself.

此番话令守卫大为不安，因馆内有价值以数百万美元计之之计算机设备。故此守卫细察此人。然此人仅挪至另一摊位，口中念念有词。

> When the man left, the guard took him aside and searched his clothes, but nothing was to be found.

此人离去时，守卫拽之至一旁搜其身，竟无所获。

> On the next day of the trade show, the man returned and chided the guard, saying: "I escaped with a vast booty yesterday, but today will be even better." So the guard watched him ever more closely, but to no avail.

展会次日，此人又至，责之于守卫曰：“吾昨日已掳巨额之战利品，今之收获将俞佳。”于是守卫益加密切察之，然未见异样。

> On the final day of the trade show, the guard could restrain his curiosity no longer. "Sir Thief," he said, "I am so perplexed, I cannot live in peace. Please enlighten me. What is it that you are stealing?"

展会结束之日，守卫终难抑好奇之心，乃问曰：“窃贼君，吾心实惑，难以安寐。求告之，君究窃何物？”

> The man smiled. "I am stealing ideas," he said.

此人笑曰，“吾偷创意而”。

> There once was a Master Programmer who wrote unstructured programs. A novice programmer, seeking to imitate him, also began to write unstructured programs. When the novice asked the Master to evaluate his progress, the Master criticized him for writing unstructured programs, saying, "What is appropriate for the Master is not appropriate for the novice. You must understand Tao before transcending structure."

昔有编程大师者，擅编无结构之程序。弟子仿之，亦编写无结构之程序。弟子请大师评其程序，大师批曰：“适师者非亦适徒也。欲超越结构，必先悟道。”

> There was once a programmer who was attached to the court of the warlord of Wu. The warlord asked the programmer: "Which is easier to design: an accounting package or an operating system?"

昔有程序员于吴氏企业任职。吴总问之于程序员曰：“财务系统与操作系统，设计孰易？”

> "An operating system," replied the programmer.

“操作系统，”猿答曰。

> The warlord uttered an exclamation of disbelief. "Surely an accounting package is trivial next to the complexity of an operating system," he said.

吴总叹曰：“与操作系统之复杂性比之，财务系统设计定易如反掌乎？”

> "Not so," said the programmer, "When designing an accounting package, the programmer operates as a mediator between people having different ideas: how it must operate, how its reports must appear, and how it must conform to the tax laws. By contrast, an operating system is not limited by outside appearances. When designing an operating system, the programmer seeks the simplest harmony between machine and ideas. This is why an operating system is easier to design."

程序员曰，“非也，设计财务系统时，程序员是协调者，助人于不同使用需求间达成一致，如操作界面、显示报表、遵守税法等。然操作系统无受前端之限。设计操作系统时，程序员只需在机器与想法之间，寻求极易之和谐统一。故操作系统设计易之。”

> The warlord of Wu nodded and smiled. "That is all good and well, but which is easier to debug?"

吴总点头笑曰：“善，何者更易调试？”

> The programmer made no reply.

猿未答。



> A manager went to the Master Programmer and showed him the requirements document for a new application. The manager asked the Master: "How long will it take to design this system if I assign five programmers to it?"

一主管寻编程大师，请其阅一应用程序之需求文档。主管问：“若令五猿设计此系统，耗时何如？”

> "It will take one year," said the Master promptly.

“需耗一年，”大师速曰。

> "But we need this system immediately or even sooner! How long will it take if I assign ten programmers to it?"

“然当下亟需此系统，愈速愈佳！十猿何如？”

> The Master Programmer frowned. "In that case, it will take two years."

大师皱眉曰，“如此，两年。”

> "And what if I assign a hundred programmers to it?"

“百猿何如？”

> The Master Programmer shrugged. "Then the design will never be completed," he said.

大师无奈曰，“此设计恐永不可成”
