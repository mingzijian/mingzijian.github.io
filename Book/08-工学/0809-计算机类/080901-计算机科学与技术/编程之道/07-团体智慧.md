> A novice asked the Master: "In the East, there is a great tree-structure that men call 'Corporate Headquarters'. It is bloated out of shape with vice presidents and accountants. It issues a multitude of memos, each saying 'Go Hence!' or 'Go Hither!' and nobody knows what is meant. Every year new names are put onto the branches, but all to no avail. How can such an unnatural entity exist?"

弟子问大师：“在西方，有一个巨大的树状结构组织，人们称之为‘企业总部’。里面的副总裁和财务人员多如牛毛，整个组织臃肿不堪。它每天发布大量的备忘录，每一条都写着‘做这个’‘做那个’，没人知道是什么意思。每年，有很多新人加入各个分公司，但都无济于事。为什么会有这么怪异的组织呢？”

> The Master replied: "You perceive this immense structure and are disturbed that it has no rational purpose. Can you not take amusement from its endless gyrations? Do you not enjoy the untroubled ease of programming beneath its sheltering branches? Why are you bothered by its uselessness?"

大师答：“你对这个巨大的结构感到不安，因为它没有合理的目的。可是从它不停歇的运作中，你难道不能发现快乐吗？在其枝叶的遮蔽下，你难道不享受编程的轻松自在吗？你为何因为它的无用而苦恼呢？”

> In the East there is a shark which is larger than all other fish. It changes into a bird whose wings are like clouds filling the sky.

东方有鱼，其名为鲲。鲲之大，绵绵若千里之远；化而为鸟，其名为鹏。鹏之翼，皇皇若垂天之云。

> When this bird moves across the land, it brings a message from Corporate Headquarters. This message drops into the midst of the programmers, like a seagull making its mark upon the beach. Then the bird mounts on the wind and, with the blue sky at its back, returns home.

这只大鸟从东边飞来，带来了企业总部的消息。如海鸥掠过沙滩，大鸟将消息撒播于猿间。后背负青天，扶摇直上，缓缓归去。

> The novice programmer stares in wonder at the bird, for he understands it not. The average programmer dreads the coming of the bird, for he fears its message. The Master Programmer continues to work at his terminal, unaware that the bird has come and gone.

初等猿不明其意，好奇盯之。中等猿惧之，意恐总部消息之不利。而编程大师专心致志，未觉鸿鹄之去留。

> The Magician of the Ivory Tower brought his latest invention for the Master Programmer to examine. The Magician wheeled a large black box into the Master's office while the Master waited in silence.

来自象牙塔的老学究请编程大师看看他的最新发明。大师默默等着，老学究推着一个大黑匣子进了大师的办公室。

> "This is an integrated, distributed, general-purpose workstation," began the Magician, "ergonomically designed with a proprietary operating system, sixth generation languages, and multiple state of the art user interfaces. It took my assistants several hundred man years to construct. Is it not amazing?"

老学究曰：“此乃集成、分布式之通用工作站也，合乎人体工程学之设计，配以专有操作系统，第六代语言为之，备有多般先进之用户界面。吾之助手，累数世之人天以建之，壮哉？”

> The Master Programmer raised his eyebrows slightly. "It is indeed amazing," he said.

编程大师轻挑眉头曰：“诚然甚壮”

> "Corporate Headquarters has commanded," continued the Magician, "that everyone use this workstation as a platform for new programs. Do you agree to this?"

“总部已经下令，”老学究继续说，“对于未来的新项目，所有人都得用这个工作站作为新的开发平台。你同意吗？”

> "Certainly," replied the Master. "I will have it transported to the Data Center immediately!" And the Magician returned to his tower, well pleased.

“当然，”大师答道。“我马上把它送到数据中心去！”老学究满意地回到了象牙塔。

> Several days later, a novice wandered into the office of the Master Programmer and said, "I cannot find the listing for my new program. Do you know where it might be?"

几天后，一位新手走进编程大师的办公室，说：“我找不着我新项目的文件了。你知道它在哪儿吗？”

> "Yes," replied the Master, "the listings are stacked on the platform in the Data Center."

“知道，”大师回答，“它们在数据中心平台上放着呢。”

> The Master Programmer moves from program to program without fear. No change in management can harm him. He will not be fired, even if the project is cancelled. Why is this? He is filled with Tao.

编程大师从一个项目转到另一个项目，心中丝毫不慌。任何管理上的变动都影响不了他。即使砍掉项目，上级也不会解雇他。为什么呢？因为他心中充满了道。
