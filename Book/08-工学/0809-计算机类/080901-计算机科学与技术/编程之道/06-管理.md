### 6.3



> A manager was about to be fired, but a programmer who worked for him wrote a new program that became popular and sold well. As a result, the manager retained his job.

主管将被解雇之际，其一下属程序员编一新程序，此程序大受欢迎，销量甚好。结果，主管保职。

> The manager tried to give the programmer a bonus, but the programmer refused it, saying, "I wrote the program because I thought it was an interesting concept, and thus I expect no reward."

主管欲奖赏此程序员，程序员拒曰：“吾编此程序只为实现一趣想，无求它奖。”

> The manager upon hearing this remarked, "This programmer, though he holds a position of small esteem, understands well the proper duty of an employee. Let us promote him to the exalted position of management consultant!"

主管听毕，评曰：“此人职虽不高，员工应尽之责了然。吾等应聘其为公司之管理顾问！”

> But when told this, the programmer once more refused, saying, "I exist so that I can program. If I were promoted, I would do nothing but waste everyone's time. Can I go now? I have a program that I am working on."

程序员听毕，再拒曰：“吾来此是为编码。若升职，反无所会，徒费功夫尔。吾可去乎？吾尚有一项目待做。”

> A manager went to his programmers and told them: "As regards to your work hours: you are going to have to come in at nine in the morning and leave at five in the afternoon." At this, all of them became angry and several resigned on the spot.

主管对他手下之程序员说：“关于工作时间之规定下来了：以后你们必须早上九点上班，下午五点下班。”听了这话，所有人都很生气，有几个当场辞职了。

> So the manager said: "All right, in that case you may set your own working hours, as long as you finish your projects on schedule." The programmers, now satisfied, began to come in at noon and work to the wee hours of the morning.

于是主管说：“好吧，这样之话，以后你们自己安排工作时间，只要保证按时完成项目。”程序员们这下满意了，从中午开始工作，一直忙碌到凌晨。

## 7. Corporate Wisdom 企业智慧



> Thus spake the Master Programmer:

编程大师如是说：

> "You can demonstrate a program for a corporate executive, but you can't make him computer literate."

“你可以给企业高管演示程序，但无法让他精通电脑。”
