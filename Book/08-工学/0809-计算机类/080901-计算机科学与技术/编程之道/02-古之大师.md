> Thus spake the Master Programmer:

编程大师曰：

> "After three days without programming, life becomes meaningless."

“三日不编程，生命意不存。”

> The programmers of old were mysterious and profound. We cannot fathom their thoughts, so all we do is describe their appearance.

古猿玄妙。不解其志，概描其貌。

> Aware, like a fox crossing the water.

觉察，如狐狸游过水面

> Alert, like a general on the battlefield.

警惕，如将军坐镇战场

> Kind, like a hostess greeting her guests.

亲切，如主人迎接客人

> Simple, like uncarved blocks of wood.

简单，如木块未经雕刻

> Opaque, like black pools in darkened caves.

隐晦，如穴中幽暗水池

> Who can tell the secrets of their hearts and minds?

谁能窥探他们的内心，谁能看穿他们的想法？

> The answer exists only in Tao.

答案尽在道中。

> The Grand Master Turing once dreamed that he was a machine. When he awoke, he exclaimed:

昔者图灵梦为机器，俄然觉：

> "I don't know whether I am Turing dreaming that I am a machine, or a machine dreaming that I am Turing!"

“不知图灵之梦为机器与，机器之梦为图灵与！”

> A programmer from a very large computer company went to a software conference and then returned to report to his manager, saying: "What sort of programmers work for other companies? They behaved badly and were unconcerned with appearances. Their hair was long and unkempt and their clothes were wrinkled and old. They crashed our hospitality suite and they made rude noises during my presentation."

一位大型计算机公司的程序员去参加一个软件会议，回来后向他的老板汇报，说：“其他公司的程序员怎么是这个样子？他们不讲礼貌，不注重外表——头发又长又乱，衣服又皱又旧。不仅闯进我们的接待室，还在我演讲时随便说话。”

> The manager said: "I should have never sent you to the conference. Those programmers live beyond the physical world. They consider life absurd, an accidental coincidence. They come and go without knowing limitations. Without a care, they live only for their programs. Why should they bother with social conventions?"

老板说：“我不该让你去参会的。那些程序员早已从现实世界超脱。他们认为生活是荒谬的，只是一场偶然的巧合。他们来去随心，不受限制。没有牵挂的他们，只为程序而活。社会习俗如何能左右他们？”

> "They are alive within the Tao."

老板说：“我不该让你去参会的。那些程序员早已从现实世界超脱。他们认为生活是荒谬的，只是一场偶然的巧合。他们来去随心，不受限制。没有牵挂的他们，只为程序而活。社会习俗如何能左右他们？”

> A novice asked the Master: "Here is a programmer that never designs, documents or tests his programs. Yet all who know him consider him one of the best programmers in the world. Why is this?"

弟子问大师：“有位程序员从来不提前设计自己的程序，也不写文档或进行测试。但所有认识他的人都视他为世上最好的程序员之一。为什么？”

> The Master replied: "That programmer has mastered the Tao. He has gone beyond the need for design; he does not become angry when the system crashes, but accepts the universe without concern. He has gone beyond the need for documentation; he no longer cares if anyone else sees his code. He has gone beyond the need for testing; each of his programs are perfect within themselves, serene and elegant, their purpose self-evident. Truly, he has entered the mystery of Tao."

大师回答说：“因为他已得道。他不再需要设计：当系统崩溃时，他不会生气，而是毫不在意地接受现实；他不再需要文档：他不关心是否有人看到他的代码；他不再需要测试：他的每个程序都是完美的，平静而优雅，程序的目的不言而喻。他已经领悟了道的真意。”
