> Thus spake the Master Programmer:

编程大师曰：

> "Without the wind, the grass does not move. Without software hardware is useless."

“没有风，草就不会动；没有软件，硬件就没用。”



> A novice asked the Master: "I perceive that one computer company is much larger than all others. It towers above its competition like a giant among dwarfs. Any one of its divisions could comprise an entire business. Why is this so?"

弟子问大师：“我发现有家计算机公司的规模堪称世界之最。它高高在上，鹤立鸡群。它的任何一个部门都可以组成一个完整的公司。为何会这样呢？”

> The Master replied, "Why do you ask such foolish questions? That company is large because it is large. If it only made hardware, nobody would buy it. If it only made software, nobody would use it. If it only maintained systems, people would treat it like a servant. But because it combines all of these things, people think it one of the gods! By not seeking to strive, it conquers without effort."

大师答道：“你怎么会问这么蠢的问题？因为那家公司很大，所以它很大。如果它只生产硬件，没人会买它的东西。如果它只做软件，没人会用它的东西。如果它只维护系统，用户会把它当成仆人。但正因为它现在什么都做，人们会将它捧上神坛！因为选择不精益求精，它毫不费力地征服了一切。”



> A Master Programmer passed a novice programmer one day.

一天，编程大师从一个弟子身边路过。

> The Master noted the novice's preoccupation with a hand-held computer game.

大师发现弟子正专心致志地玩着掌上游戏机。

> "Excuse me," he said, "may I examine it?"

“不好意思，”大师说，“可以让我看看你的游戏机吗？”

> The novice bolted to attention and handed the device to the Master. "I see that the device claims to have three levels of play: Easy, Medium, and Hard," said the Master. "Yet every such device has another level of play, where the device seeks not to conquer the human, nor to be conquered by the human."

弟子抬起头，把机器递给了大师。“这游戏机上显示有三种等级的玩法：简单、中等和困难，”大师说，“但这种游戏机还有另一种隐藏玩法。在隐藏玩法下，机器既不会让玩家赢，也不会让玩家输。”

> "Pray, Great Master," implored the novice, "how does one find this mysterious setting?"

“请告诉我，大师，”弟子恳求道，“何以入？”

> The Master dropped the device to the ground and crushed it with his heel. Suddenly the novice was enlightened.

大师弃机与地，踩碎之。一瞬间，弟子若有所悟。



> There was once a programmer who wrote software for personal computers. "Look at how well off I am here," he said to a mainframe programmer who came to visit. "I have my own operating system and file storage device. I do not have to share my resources with anyone. The software is self-consistent and easy-to-use. Why do you not quit your present job and join me here?"

从前，有位 PC 机程序员邀请一位大型机程序员来做客。“看看我这儿多好，”他对大型机程序员说，”我有自己的操作系统和文件存储设备，不需要和任何人共享资源。软件易用、彼此兼容。考虑辞职来和我一起干吗？”

> The mainframe programmer then began to describe his system to his friend, saying, "The mainframe sits like an ancient Sage meditating in the midst of the Data Center. Its disk drives lie end-to-end like a great ocean of machinery. The software is as multifaceted as a diamond, and as convoluted as a primeval jungle. The programs, each unique, move through the system like a swift-flowing river. That is why I am happy where I am."

大型机程序员开始描述他的系统：“大型机就像一个古老的圣人，坐在数据中心的中央冥想。它的磁盘驱动器彼此相连，形成巨大的机器海洋。软件像钻石般多面、像原始森林般复杂。内部的程序，个个独一无二，运行起来如同一条湍急的河流，在系统中奔腾涌动。因此，我对我现在的工作很满意。”

> The personal computer programmer, upon hearing this, fell silent. But the two programmers remained friends until the end of their days.

PC 机程序员听完陷入了沉默。不过，这两位程序员做了一辈子的朋友。

> Hardware met Software on the road to Changtse. Software said: "You are Yin and I am Yang. If we travel together, we will become famous and earn vast sums of money." And so they set forth together, thinking to conquer the world.

在通往长江的路上，硬件和软件相遇了。软件说：“你是阴，我是阳。我们结伴而行，日后一定会出名、赚大钱。”于是他们一同出发，想要征服世界。

> Presently, they met Firmware, who was dressed in tattered rags and hobbled along propped on a thorny stick. Firmware said to them: "The Tao lies beyond Yin and Yang. It is silent and still as a pool of water. It does not seek fame; therefore, nobody knows its presence. It does not seek fortune, for it is complete within itself. It exists beyond space and time."

不久，他们碰见了固件。固件衣衫褴褛，拄着一根拐杖，步履蹒跚地走着。固件对他们说：“道在阴阳之外。它似一潭止水，寂静无声。它不求闻达，所以没人知道它在哪儿。它不求财富，因为它自身已完整无缺。它独立于时空存在。”

> Software and Hardware, ashamed, returned to their homes.

软件和硬件羞愧不已，回到了各自的家。
