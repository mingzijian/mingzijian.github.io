#### 废弃
We've Moved!
 
The JBoss AS community project has been renamed to the WildFly community project, which has a new home at wildfly.org. 
 
The JBoss name now only applies to the commercially supported product, called JBoss EAP, which is derived from the WildFly community project and is available here.
 
For more information on the differences between the project and product offerings, see the JBoss.ORG technology page.
 
You can find old JBoss AS community releases on our archived downloads page, however, these releases are not maintained and therefore are likely to contain bugs and security vulnerabilities. It is highly recommended that you upgrade to WildFly or JBoss EAP using the above links at your earliest convenience. If you require assistance in making this move, please ask on the forums or contact your local Red Hat account representative.

#### 新生
WildFly，原名 JBoss AS(JBoss Application Server) 或者 JBoss，是一套应用程序服务器，属于开源的企业级 Java 中间件软件，用于实现基于 SOA 架构的 Web 应用和服务。 WildFly 包含一组可独立运行的软件。

红帽公司宣布 JBoss AS 的继任者 WildFly，WildFly 将推动下一代应用服务器技术的发展，这个项目的名字是 JBoss.org 社区成员在 2012 年底投票产生。
